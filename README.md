# Hi!

As a hacker by nature, I enjoy making things. My name is Aijaz Ansari and I'm an Engineering Manager at [Gogo][ba]. My personal blog can be found at [aijaz.net][bl].


## Current Projects

- I serve at [Muslim Youth for Positive Impact][mypi] - which is an organization dedicated to helping youth - in the following capacities:
  - Director of Technology
  - Mentor for Youth
  - Python Instructor
  - Person responsible for the annual Camping Trips (and all things Outdoors)
- I teach the Computer Science class to High School Students at [Colorado Association of Black Professional Engineers and Scientists (CABPES)][cabpes].
- For about the past fifteen years I've been the developer and 
designer behind the [Qur'an Memorizer][qm] iOS App. 
- I recently wrote the [QuranReflect][qr] iOS app, which is still very much a work in progress.
- I'm also a community organizer and previously volunteered as head of security at my local mosque. 
- Since our mosque opened up I've had to implement contact tracing and signins for attendees. I've created [an iOS app][ms] and a [companion backend site][qrcode] to handle this. An Android app is currently under development.
- I'm also a frequent public speaker. You can find a list of my talks [here][about].
