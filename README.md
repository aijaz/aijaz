# Hi!

As a hacker by nature, I enjoy making things. My name is Aijaz Ansari and I'm a Mobile Lead at [Gogo Business Aviation][ba]. My personal blog can be found at [aijaz.net][bl].


## Current Projects

- For about the past ten years I've been the developer and 
designer behind the [Qur'an Memorizer][qm] iOS App. 
- I recently wrote the [QuranReflect][qr] iOS app, which is still very much a work in progress.
- I'm also a community organizer and volunteer as head of security at my local mosque. In that capacity I also manage two additional blogs:
    + [MasjidDefense][md]
    + [The Reluctant Gun Owner][rg].
- Since our mosque opened up I've had to implement contact tracing and signins for attendees. I've created [an iOS app][ms] and a [companion backend site][qrcode] to handle this. An Android app is currently under development.
- I'm on the board of [MYPI][mypi], which is an organization dedicated to helping youth. I'm starting [a program to help teach Black youth how to code][ty], to help remove institutional barriers from youth of color.
- I'm also a frequent public speaker. You can find a list of my talks [here][about].
